## Travel Footprint 🗺️

Here are the special places that have shaped my journey, from my hometown to where I am today,
along with all the countries I've had the privilege to visit:

## Beyond Work

When I'm not working with numbers and data, I enjoy exploring the world and pursuing
various interests:

- **✈️ Travel & Adventure**: I love exploring new places and cultures around the world.
  From trekking to Everest Base Camp (5000m) to discovering hidden gems in cities,
  travel fuels my curiosity and broadens my perspective. Each journey teaches me
  something new about the world and myself.
- **🏀 Sports**: Basketball (university team member)
- **🎵 Music**: Playing Guzheng (Level 8, national certificate)
- **🍳 Cooking**: Fusion of Sichuan and Mediterranean styles
- **📚 Reading & Learning**: Always curious about new ideas and perspectives (check out my [bookshelf](/books/))
- **💻 Coding & Competitions**: Participating in hackathons and data science competitions
- **🤝 Community**: Co-founded and led the Actuarial Society at University of Edinburgh,
  growing it to 100+ members
