I'm an Actuarial Associate at PwC and a MFin student at LSE, with a BSc (Hons)
in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Edinburgh.

I enjoy working at the intersection of finance, technology and data. I like taking complex
or unstructured problems, finding the logic behind them, and turning them into clear and
useful solutions. Recently I’ve been especially interested in how AI and new technologies
can support better decision-making, improve learning experiences and create more global
and accessible ways of working.

I'm particularly interested in consulting, data-driven strategy and technology-focused roles
where analytical thinking creates real business impact.
