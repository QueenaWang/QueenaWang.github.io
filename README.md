## About

I'm an **Actuarial Associate** at PwC and a part-time **MFin student** at LSE, with a **BSc (Hons) in Mathematics and Statistics** from the University of Edinburgh.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **finance, technology and data**. I like taking complex or unstructured problems, finding the logic behind them, and turning them into clear and useful solutions. Recently I've been especially interested in how AI and new technologies can support better decision-making, improve learning experiences and create more global and accessible ways of working.

I'm particularly interested in consulting, data-driven strategy and technology-focused roles where analytical thinking creates real business impact.
